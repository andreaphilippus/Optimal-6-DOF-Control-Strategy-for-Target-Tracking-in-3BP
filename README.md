Began in Summer 2022 and continued in Fall 2022 as an individual study project (AAE 59700ZS) at Purdue University (West Lafayette); supervised by Professor Kenshiro Oguri.


Problem Description: An active spacecraft is to approach and dock to a passive spacecraft in a periodic orbit around Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point with optimal amount of fuel.


The code uses CasADi (https://web.casadi.org/) library for optimal control calculation.


This project is a continuation of the final project in a course, Applied Optimal Control and Estimation (AAE 56800), instructed by Professor Inseok Hwang in Spring 2022:

Optimal Station-Keeping of a Satellite around the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange Point using Model Predictive Control
